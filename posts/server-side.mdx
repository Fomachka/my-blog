NextJS is a **framework for ReactJS**.

If you are not `already` familiar with heading anchors, check out any README.md on GitHub or hover over a heading within most blog posts and you will likely see a small link icon or hashtag to the left of the title, indicating that you can click to anchor to that specific heading.

If you'd like to link someone to a specific part of a blog post, you can simply click the title you want to send them to and the address bar is automatically populated with an anchor that will link directly to that section.

## Why would we then need NextJS?

Because NextJS makes building React apps easier - especially React apps that should have server-side rendering (though it does way more than just take care of that).

In this article, we'll dive into the core concepts and features NextJS has to offer:

- File-based **Routing**
- Built-in Page Pre-rendering
- Rich Data Fetching Capabilities
- Image Optimization
- Much More

```js
const basics = 'Okay, that should not be too difficult actually';

function printBasics() {
  console.log(basics):
}

printBasics();
```

My favorite search engine is [Duck Duck Go](https://duckduckgo.com).
I just love **bold text**.
