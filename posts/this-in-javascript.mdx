As you may know, `this` keyword is very tricky in Javascript. In this article, we will together demistify `this` keyword in JavaScript in detail and in a way that's easy to understand!

## What is `this`?

In JavaScript, `this` is a keyword that refers to the current context or object. It can be used in different ways depending on its location within the code. Basically, `this` is a reference to the object that the current code is a part of.

## How does `this` work?

The value of `this` is determined at runtime, based on how the code is executed. The value of `this` can change depending on the context in which it is used.

To better understand this concept, let's look at some examples:

### Example 1: Using `this` inside an object method

```js
const person = {
  name: "John",
  sayHello: function () {
    console.log(`Hello, my name is ${this.name}!`);
  },
};

person.sayHello();
```

In this example, we have an object called `person` with a property called `name` and a method called `sayHello`. The `sayHello` method uses the `this` keyword to refer to the `person` object, so it can access the `name` property.

When we call `person.sayHello()`, the value of `this` inside the `sayHello` function will be the `person` object. Therefore, it will output "Hello, my name is John!".

### Example 2: Using `this` with a function that is not an object method

```js
const sayHello = function () {
  console.log(`Hello, my name is ${this.name}!`);
};

const person1 = {
  name: "John",
  sayHello: sayHello,
};

const person2 = {
  name: "Jane",
  sayHello: sayHello,
};

person1.sayHello();
person2.sayHello();
```

In this example, we have a function called `sayHello` that uses the `this` keyword to refer to the object that it is called on. We then create two objects called `person1` and `person2`, each with a `name` property and a `sayHello` method that uses the `sayHello` function.

When we call `person1.sayHello()`, the value of `this` inside the `sayHello` function will be the `person1` object. Therefore, it will output "Hello, my name is John!". When we call `person2.sayHello()`, the value of `this` inside the `sayHello` function will be the `person2` object. Therefore, it will output "Hello, my name is Jane!".

### Example 3: Using `this` with a callback function

```js
const button = document.querySelector("button");

button.addEventListener("click", function () {
  console.log(`The button was clicked by ${this.textContent}`);
});
```

In this example, we have a button element in the HTML document, and we use JavaScript to add an event listener to it. The event listener function uses the `this` keyword to refer to the button element that triggered the event.

When we click the button, the value of `this` inside the event listener function will be the button element. Therefore, it will output "The button was clicked by [the text content of the button]" (e.g. "The button was clicked by Click me!").

## Why is `this` important?

Understanding the `this` keyword is important in JavaScript because it allows us to write more dynamic and reusable code. By using `this`, we can refer to the current context or object and make our code more flexible.

However, it's important

### Using `this` in Constructor Functions

Another common usage of `this` is in constructor functions. Constructor functions are used to create objects with similar properties and methods. When we use the `new` keyword with a constructor function, it creates a new instance of the object.

```js
function Person(name, age) {
  this.name = name;
  this.age = age;
}

const person1 = new Person("Alice", 25);
console.log(person1.name); // Alice

const person2 = new Person("Bob", 30);
console.log(person2.age); // 30
```

In the `Person` constructor function, `this` refers to the instance of the object that is being created. We use `this` to set the `name` and `age` properties of the object.

### The Value of `this` in Event Listeners

In event listeners, the value of `this` is often important. In this context, `this` refers to the element that triggered the event. Let's consider an example:

```html
<button id="my-button">Click me!</button>
```

```js
const button = document.getElementById("my-button");

button.addEventListener("click", function () {
  console.log(this); // logs the button element
});
```

In this example, we use `document.getElementById` to get a reference to the button element. We then attach an event listener to the button using `addEventListener`. When the button is clicked, the event listener is triggered, and `this` inside the event listener function refers to the button element.

### Avoiding `this` Pitfalls

While `this` can be a powerful tool in JavaScript, it can also cause confusion and bugs if not used correctly. Here are a few pitfalls to be aware of:

- **`this` in Arrow Functions**: Arrow functions don't have their own `this` binding, so they always use the `this` value of their enclosing context. This can be useful, but can also lead to unexpected behavior if the enclosing context isn't what you expect.
- **`this` in Callback Functions**: Callback functions are often used in asynchronous code, where `this` can be lost. In these cases, it's common to use the `bind` method to ensure that `this` refers to the correct value.
- **`this` in Object Methods**: When defining methods on objects, it's important to be aware of how `this` will be used. If the method is called on the object itself, `this` will refer to the object. However, if the method is called on a different object or in a different context, `this` will no longer refer to the original object.

In general, it's important to pay attention to where `this` is being used and to think carefully about its value in different contexts. With practice, using `this` effectively can become second nature, and it can be a powerful tool for writing clean and modular JavaScript code.

### Using `call`, `apply`, and `bind` to Control `this`

Sometimes, we may want to explicitly set the value of `this` for a function, rather than relying on the default behavior. We can use the `call`, `apply`, and `bind` methods to achieve this.

#### `call`

The `call` method allows us to call a function with a specified `this` value and arguments provided individually.

```js
const person = {
  fullName: function () {
    return this.firstName + " " + this.lastName;
  },
};

const person1 = {
  firstName: "John",
  lastName: "Doe",
};

const person2 = {
  firstName: "Mary",
  lastName: "Doe",
};

console.log(person.fullName.call(person1)); // John Doe
console.log(person.fullName.call(person2)); // Mary Doe
```

In this example, we define an object `person` with a `fullName` method that returns the first name and last name properties of the object. We then define two more objects, `person1` and `person2`, and use the `call` method to call the `fullName` method with each object as the `this` value.

#### `apply`

The `apply` method is similar to the `call` method, but takes an array of arguments instead of individual arguments.

```js
const numbers = [5, 6, 2, 3, 7];

const max = Math.max.apply(null, numbers);
console.log(max); // 7
```

In this example, we use the `apply` method to find the maximum value in an array of numbers. We pass `null` as the `this` value (since the `Math.max` method doesn't require a `this` value), and pass the `numbers` array as the arguments.

#### `bind`

The `bind` method returns a new function with the `this` value set to a specified object.

```js
const person = {
  fullName: function () {
    return this.firstName + " " + this.lastName;
  },
};

const person1 = {
  firstName: "John",
  lastName: "Doe",
};

const person2 = {
  firstName: "Mary",
  lastName: "Doe",
};

const fullName1 = person.fullName.bind(person1);
console.log(fullName1()); // John Doe

const fullName2 = person.fullName.bind(person2);
console.log(fullName2()); // Mary Doe
```

In this example, we define an object `person` with a `fullName` method. We then define two more objects, `person1` and `person2`, and use the `bind` method to create two new functions with the `this` value set to `person1` and `person2`, respectively.

### Note

The `this` keyword in JavaScript is used to refer to the current object in a particular context. The value of `this` can change depending on the location within the code where it is used. By understanding the different ways `this` can be used and how it changes, you can write more effective and modular code. Additionally, by using methods like `call`, `apply`, and `bind`, you can gain more control over the value of `this` in your functions.
