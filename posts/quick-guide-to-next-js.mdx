## Prerequisites

Before you begin, you'll need to have Node.js and npm installed on your machine. You can download Node.js from the official website and install it using the installer. You can verify that Node.js is installed by running the following command in your terminal:

```nodejs
node - v;
```

You should see the version number of Node.js printed in the terminal.

## Creating a New Next.js Project

To create a new Next.js project, you can use the `create-next-app` CLI tool provided by Next.js. This tool creates a new Next.js project with all the necessary files and configurations.

To create a new project, open your terminal and run the following command:

```nodejs
npx create-next-app my-next-app
```

Replace `my-next-app` with the name of your project. This command will create a new Next.js project in a directory named `my-next-app`.

## Running the Project

Once the project is created, you can navigate to the project directory using the `cd` command:

```nodejs
cd my-next-app
```

To start the development server, run the following command:

```nodejs
npm run dev
```

This will start the development server and open your application in the browser. You can start making changes to your application and see the changes live in the browser.

## Remember

Starting a new Next.js project is easy and straightforward. With the `create-next-app` CLI tool, you can create a new project in seconds and start building your application right away. Next.js offers a great development experience and many features that make building modern web applications a breeze.
