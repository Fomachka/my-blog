This blog is built with Next.js and fueled by green tea and love. Here, you'll find a mix of:

- Tech ramblings: My adventures in the world of web development, from front-end frameworks to back-end(not really) solutions.
- Life musings: Random thoughts and reflections on anything that piques my interest.
- Creative explorations: Experimenting with different writing styles and formats.
